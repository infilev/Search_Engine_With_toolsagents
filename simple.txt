EXPLANATION OF THE CODE (SOURCE: GPT)


This code snippet handles the chat history management and interaction flow in a Streamlit app. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Managing Chat History
python
Copy code
if "messages" not in st.session_state or st.sidebar.button("Clear message hsitory"):
    st.session_state["messages"] = [
        {
            "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi! How can I help you?"
        },
    ]
Purpose: Initializes or clears the chat history.
Explanation:
st.session_state["messages"]: This stores the chat history as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message.
The if condition checks if the messages key exists in st.session_state. If not, it initializes it with a default assistant message: "Hi! How can I help you?".
If the "Clear message history" button on the sidebar is pressed, it resets the chat history.




2. Displaying Existing Chat History
python
Copy code
for msg in st.session_state.messages:
    st.chat_message(msg["role"]).write(msg['content'])
Purpose: Displays the messages stored in the session state.
Explanation:
Iterates over each message in st.session_state["messages"].
Uses st.chat_message to render the message on the UI, distinguishing between the role (user or assistant) and the content of the message.



3. Handling New User Input
python
Copy code
user_query = st.chat_input(placeholder="Ask anything from the database")
Purpose: Creates an input box where the user can type their query.
Explanation:
st.chat_input: A Streamlit widget for chat input, with a placeholder guiding the user.
The user’s input is stored in the variable user_query.




4. Appending User Query to Chat History
python
Copy code
if user_query:
    st.session_state.messages.append(
        {
            "role": "user", "content": user_query
        }  
    )
    st.chat_message("user").write(user_query)

Purpose: Adds the user's query to the chat history and displays it.
Explanation:
Checks if user_query contains input.
Appends the user query to st.session_state["messages"] with the role user.
Immediately displays the user’s message on the chat interface using st.chat_message.



5. Generating Assistant's Response
python
Copy code
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    streamlit_callback = StreamlitCallbackHandler(
        st.container(),
    )

    response = agent.run(
        user_query,
        callbacks=[streamlit_callback]
    )
Purpose: Passes the user query to the agent, gets a response, and displays it.
Explanation:
Uses a with block to indicate that the assistant's message is being processed.
StreamlitCallbackHandler: Tracks and displays the assistant's intermediate thoughts or actions in real-time.
agent.run(user_query, callbacks=[streamlit_callback]): Runs the query through the agent and captures the response.



6. Appending Assistant Response to Chat History
python
Copy code
st.session_state.messages.append(
    {
        "role": "assistant", "content": response
    }
)
st.write(response)
Purpose: Stores the assistant’s response in the chat history and displays it.



Explanation:
Appends the response to st.session_state["messages"] under the role assistant.
Renders the response in the chat interface.
Overall Workflow
The app initializes the chat history or clears it if the user clicks the "Clear message history" button.
Existing chat messages are displayed.
The user types a query, which is stored in the session state and displayed.
The query is sent to the agent, which processes it and generates a response.
The response is displayed and stored in the chat history for future interactions.
